Version 20120131
 * Delete Breathless. It seems the license for some icons is not opensource.
 * Delete LeoLike. Not sure about what the real license is.

Version 0.1.21
 * Added the theme LeoLike.

Version 0.1.20
 * Added the new theme Oxygen, created by Dariusz Jakoniuk 
   <pipaceliny@interia.pl>, based on Oxygen-Refit but using some of the 
   original Oxygen icons. The license of the Oxygen icons (according to
   http://www.oxygen-icons.org/?page_id=4) is dual:  
   Creative Common Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License or the GNU Library 
   General Public License.
 * Added the theme Oxygen-Air.
 * Deleted the theme Play. It was just an example.

Version 0.1.19
 * Updated the Gnome theme.

Version 0.1.18
 * Updated the Gnome theme.

Version 0.1.17
 * Fixed Gartoon/rewind1m.png. The background was white instead of transparent.
   Fixes bug #2002560.
 * Revision 1821 of smplayer adds a new icon for Play/Pause (play_pause.png).
   That breaks all icon themes (the new icon appears in all themes). As a 
   quick fix, I've just created a play_pause.png in all themes, which is just
   a copy of play.png.

Version 0.1.16
 * Added the theme 'Gnome' by <31337h4ck3r@gmail.com>. Icons taken 
   from The GNOME Project. License: GNU General Public License and 
   GNU Lesser General Public License.

Version 0.1.15
 * Modified and added some icons to the Nuvola theme.
 * Added the license texts for GPL, LGPL, Creative Commons 
   Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 and Creative Commons Attribution 2.5.
 * Temporary removed blackPanther-MacLike because it doesn't include
   copyright info.

   for Gnome.

 * Updated the Tango theme.

Version 0.1.3
 * Added the Tango theme by Yurkovsky Andrey <anyr@tut.by>
 * Removed the Oxygen theme as I don't know the license of the icons.

Version 0.1.2
 * Renamed the debian directory to debian-rvm, so it doesn't conflict with
   the one made by package maintainers.
   So if want to create a deb package with dpkg-buidpackage, rename it back 
   to debian (or create a symlink).
 * Added a dependency on smplayer in the control file.

Version 0.1.1
 * Use DESTDIR in Makefile.
 * Added the debian subdirectory.
